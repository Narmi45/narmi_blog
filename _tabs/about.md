Greetings, I'm Imran Khan, an aspiring Information Security Specialist, CTF-Player, gamer, and now, blogger. I launched this site in 2023 to chronicle my journey into the world of cyber security.

My passion for ethical hacking began in 2020 when I completed Heath Adam's Practicals to Ethical Hacking course, and I haven't looked back since. I'm thrilled to pursue a career as a computer penetration tester and contribute to the field of Cybersecurity. My ultimate goal is to create a platform that can guide others on their journey to ethical hacking.

Over the past few years, I have developed lab environments and researched the pillars of penetration testing, which are Web-Application Penetration Testing, Network Penetration Testing, and Active Directory Penetration Testing. I have meticulously documented my notes and observations and intend to convert them into blog posts for others to read and learn from. I also plan to use this blog as a forum to discuss current and trending security-related news.

Beyond my passion for cybersecurity, I indulge in other activities such as participating in CTFs (especially on HackTheBox), watching anime, or playing video games. Additionally, as a Computer Science major, I am cramming for classes as I'm on the brink of graduation this semester.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me. If you want to connect, feel free to reach out.
